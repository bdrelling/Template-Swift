opt_in_rules:
  - attributes # Attributes should be on their own lines in functions and types, but on the same line as variables and imports.
  - closure_end_indentation # Closure end should have the same indentation as the line that started it.
  - closure_spacing # Closure expressions should have a single space inside each brace.
  - conditional_returns_on_newline # Conditional statements should always return on the next line
  - contains_over_first_not_nil # Prefer contains over first(where:) != nil
  - convenience_type # Types used for hosting only static members should be implemented as a caseless enum to avoid instantiation.
  - explicit_init # Explicitly calling .init() should be avoided.
  - empty_count # Prefer checking `isEmpty` over comparing `count` to zero.
  - empty_string # Prefer checking isEmpty over comparing string to an empty string literal.
  # - file_header # Header comments should be consistent with project patterns. The SWIFTLINT_CURRENT_FILENAME placeholder can optionally be used in the required and forbidden patterns. It will be replaced by the real file name.
  - file_name # File name should match a type or extension declared in the file (if any).
  - first_where # "Prefer using `.first(where:)` over `.filter { }.first` in collections.
  - force_unwrapping # Force unwrapping should be avoided.
  - function_default_parameter_at_end # Prefer to locate parameters with defaults toward the end of the parameter list.
  - implicitly_unwrapped_optional # Implicitly unwrapped optionals should be avoided when possible.
  - let_var_whitespace # Let and var should be separated from other statements by a blank line.
  - literal_expression_end_indentation # Array and dictionary literal end should have the same indentation as the line that started it.
  - modifier_order # Modifier order should be consistent.
  - multiline_arguments # Arguments should be either on the same line, or one per line.
  - multiline_function_chains # Chained function calls should be either on the same line, or one per line.
  - multieline_parameters # Functions and methods parameters should be either on the same line, or one per line.
  - number_separator # Underscores should be used as thousand separator in large decimal numbers.
  - operator_usage_whitespace # Operators should be surrounded by a single whitespace
  - overridden_super_call # Some overridden methods should always call super" eg: viewDidLoad
  = private_action # IBActions should be private.
  - private_outlet # IBOutlets should be private to avoid leaking UIKit to higher layers.
  - prohibited_super_call # Some methods should not call super" eg: loadView
  - redundant_nil_coalescing # Using nil coalescing operator with nil as rhs is redundant
  - sorted_first_last # Prefer using min() or max() over sorted().first or sorted().last
  - sorted_imports # Imports should be sorted
  - switch_case_on_newline # Cases inside a switch should always end on a newline
  - switch_case_on_newline # Trailing closure syntax should be used whenever possible.
  - unneeded_parentheses_in_closure_argument # Parentheses are not needed when declaring closure arguments.
  - untyped_error_in_catch # Catch statements should not declare error variables without type casting.
  - vertical_parameter_alignment_on_call # Function parameters should be aligned vertically if they're in multiple lines in a method call.
  - vertical_whitespace # Limit vertical whitespace to a single empty line.
